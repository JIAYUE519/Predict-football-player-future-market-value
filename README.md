# Predict-football-player-future-market-value

Football is one of the world's most popular sports, played by over 250 million people in more than 200 countries. Because of the vast popularity, there is huge market value in football clubs and football clubs have to pay astronomical transfer fees for top players. Therefore, football club managers need to wisely hire a team to gain both commercial and strategic advantages. To achieve, managers will need to know the future market value of each soccer player to help them make the desicions.

The goal of the project is to analyze the FIFA player data (FIFA_Player_List.csv) and suggest the best model to predict the future market values of those football players.


It consists of four parts.

1. Data Analysis - Analyze, summarize and visualize the data and the interaction between different variables and features.

2. Feature Selection  - After the analysis, work on understanding the correlation between the independent and dependent variables and test with the different model transformations to figure out which features should be dropped. 

3. Model Selection  - Compare the L1 and L2 Norm regularization techniques (Lasso and Ridge, respectively), different penalty terms, and model transformations to build and visualize the optimal model. (Use Cross Validation to select the optimal tuning parameters and compare it with the AIC model selection)

4. Model Evaluation - Divide the data into test and train and evaluate the model along with fit, residuals, and standard error plots.
